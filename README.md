# UFOs

## Overview
###
1. Together with Dana, we will build a table using data stored in a JavaScript array with filters to make the table fully dynamic. 
2. Then we will place the table into an HTML file for easy viewing.
3. We will customize the webpage using Bootstrap, and equip our table with several fully functional filters that will allow users to interact with our visualizations.
4. Create a feature that allows users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time.

## Results
###
The webpage's search criteria allows you to filter by 5 characteristics to help provide information around UFO sightings.

You can filter by a specific state:
![CA_UFO_Sightings](https://github.com/mavalenz/UFOs/blob/main/CA_UFO_Sightings.PNG)

You can filter by multiple criteria (e.g. state and date)"
![CA_UFO_Sightings_by_Date](https://github.com/mavalenz/UFOs/blob/main/CA_UFO_Sightings_by_Date.PNG)


## Summary
###
A drawback of this new design is that it only pulls in data from one specific data source which does not contain all cities, states, dates, etc. Additional recommendations for further development would be to:

1. Expand the dataset.
2. Create more filtering criteria.
